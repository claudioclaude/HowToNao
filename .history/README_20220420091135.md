### Connecting Choreographe to physical robot

1. **Cable connection**\
  Connect NAO to the router with an Ethernet cable. Attach it from the back of its head to a spare port of the router or to a switch connected to the router.

2. **NAO's IP address**\
  When you turn on NAO, he will start saying his IP address. Note it down and type it in a browser. You will access a webpage, from there you'll be able to configure his WIFI connection.

3. **Authentication**\
  Once you loaded the webpage, you will be asked for authentication.
    - Username: nao
    - Default password: nao
    
    If login fails or if you have lost your password, visit this [link](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-1/nao/webpage_access.html#opennao-password-lost-nao).

4. **Network Settings**\
  When you reached NAO's webpage, select the network settings option and connect it to the WIFI.

- **Why choosing a WIFI connection instead of a cable connection?**\
  Connecting NAO to a WIFI network is highly recommended because he'll be able to move more freely, whithout having to pay attention to cables attached to him.

### Choreoghrape UI

![UI](img/UI.png)

- **Commands**\
  Here you can find all the commands that your NAO robot can execute. These are blocks that can be attached together to form a script, kind of like Scratch.

- **Robot view**\
  Here you can see the state of your NAO robot.\
  If you don't have a physical robot connected to your computer, this window will be your virtual robot and with it you'll be able to see how your script is behaving.

- **Connection**\
  Here you can connect Choreographe to your phisical robot or to a virtual robot.

- **Run/Stop**\
  These buttons allow you to run or stop your script.

### Creating and running a project

To start creating a script, go into the *Commands* section and choose the commands that your NAO robot will have to execute.

Make sure to connect the first block to the <kbd>onStart</kbd> connector and the last block to the <kbd>onStopped</kbd> connector.

Below is a video tutorial to better understand how to create your first script.

### YouTube tutorials

Here is the [link](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLma9tC7VHPpi8Bz4i2P5FuMlfMhjZ3nJ-) to a YouTube playlist that I found really useful to start learning how to use Choreographe.

It includes tutorials on:
  - NAO's sensors and parts
  - Choreographe basics
  - Python programming in Choreographe
  - Vision (Face recognition and NaoMarks)
  - Audio and Speech Recognition

I strongly recommend to check it out!
